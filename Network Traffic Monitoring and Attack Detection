How To Read The tcpdump Traffic Log:

This reading explains how to identify the brute force attack using tcpdump. 

14:18:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 35084+ A? yummyrecipesforme.com. (24)
14:18:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 35084 1/0/0 A 203.0.113.22 (40)

The first section of the DNS & HTTP traffic log file shows the source computer (your.machine.52444) using port 52444 to send a DNS resolution request to the DNS server (dns.google.domain) for the destination URL (yummyrecipesforme.com). Then the reply comes back from the DNS server to the source computer with the IP address of the destination URL (203.0.113.22). 

14:18:36.786501 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 2873951608, win 65495, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302576859 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
14:18:36.786517 IP yummyrecipesforme.com.http > your.machine.36086: Flags [S.], seq 3984334959, ack 2873951609, win 65483, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302576859 ecr 3302576859,nop,wscale 7], length 0

The next section shows the source computer sending a connection request (Flags [S]) from the source computer (your.machine.36086) using port 36086 directly to the destination (yummyrecipesforme.com.http). The .http suffix is the port number; http is commonly associated with port 80. The reply shows the destination acknowledging it received the connection request (Flags [S.]). The communication between the source and the intended destination continues for about 2 minutes, according to the timestamps between this block (14:18) and the next DNS resolution request (see below for the 14:20 timestamp). 

TCP Flag codes include:
Flags [S]  - Connection Start 
Flags [F]  - Connection Finish 
Flags [P]  - Data Push
Flags [R]  - Connection Reset
Flags [.]  - Acknowledgment

14:18:36.786589 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [P.], seq 1:74, ack 1, win 512, options [nop,nop,TS val 3302576859 ecr 3302576859], length 73: HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1

The log entry with the code HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1 shows the browser is requesting data from yummyrecipesforme.com with the HTTP: GET method using HTTP protocol version 1.1. This could be the download request for the malicious file. 

14:20:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 21899+ A? greatrecipesforme.com. (24)
14:20:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 21899 1/0/0 A 192.0.2.172 (40)
14:25:29.576493 IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 1020702883, win 65495, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302989649 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
14:25:29.576510 IP greatrecipesforme.com.http > your.machine.56378: Flags [S.], seq 1993648018, ack 1020702884, win 65483, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302989649 ecr 3302989649,nop,wscale 7], length 0

Then, a sudden change happens in the logs. The traffic is routed from the source computer to the DNS server again using port .52444 (your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain) to make another DNS resolution request. This time, the DNS server routes the traffic to a new IP address (192.0.2.172) and its associated URL (greatrecipesforme.com.http). The traffic changes to a route between the source computer and the spoofed website (outgoing traffic: IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http and incoming traffic: greatrecipesforme.com.http > IP your.machine.56378). Note that the port number (.56378) on the source computer has changed again when redirected to a new website.

Network Traffic Analysis:
Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the tcpdump log

As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was used to contact the DNS server to retrieve the IP address for the domain name of yummyrecipesforme.com. The ICMP protocol was used to respond with an error message, indicating issues contacting the DNS server. The UDP message going from your browser to the DNS server is shown in the first two lines of every log event. The ICMP error response from the DNS server to your browser is displayed in the third and fourth lines of every log event with the error message, “udp port 53 unreachable.” Since port 53 is associated with DNS protocol traffic, we know this is an issue with the DNS server. Issues with performing the DNS protocol are further evident because the plus sign after the query identification number 35084 indicates flags with the UDP message and the “A?” symbol indicates flags with performing DNS protocol operations. Due to the ICMP error response message about port 53, it is highly likely that the DNS server is not responding. This assumption is further supported by the flags associated with the outgoing UDP message and domain name retrieval.


Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident.
The incident occurred today at 1:24 p.m. Customers notified the organization that they received the message “destination port unreachable” when they attempted to visit the website yummyrecipesforme.com. The cybersecurity team providing IT services to their client organization are currently investigating the issue so customers can access the website again. In our investigation into the issue, we conducted packet sniffing tests using tcpdump. In the resulting log file, we found that DNS port 53 was unreachable. The next step is to identify whether the DNS server is down or traffic to port 53 is blocked by the firewall. The DNS server might be down due to a successful Denial of Service attack or a misconfiguration. 





Analyze Network Attacks:

Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this 
network interruption
One potential explanation for the website’s connection timeout error message is a DoS attack. The logs show that the web server stops responding after it is overloaded with SYN packet requests. This event could be a type of DoS attack called SYN flooding.

Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website malfunction
When the website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. The handshake consists of three steps: 

1.	A SYN packet is sent from the source to the destination, requesting to connect.
2.	The destination replies to the source with a SYN-ACK packet to accept the connection request. The destination will reserve resources for the source to connect.
3.	A final ACK packet is sent from the source to the destination acknowledging the permission to connect. 

In the case of a SYN flood attack, a malicious actor will send a large number of SYN packets all at once, which overwhelms the server’s available resources to reserve for the connection. When this happens, there are no server resources left for legitimate TCP connection requests. 

The logs indicate that the web server has become overwhelmed and is unable to process the visitors’ SYN requests. The server is unable to open a new connection to new visitors who receive a connection timeout message.
